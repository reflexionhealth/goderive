This tool extends `go generate` by detecting type and function declarations
preceded by a comment like "[Derive(MyTrait)]", and providing a higher-level
library to generate code for those declarations.

     $ go get github.com/reflexionhealth/goderive

The "github.com/goderive/traits" package provides some example code generators,
